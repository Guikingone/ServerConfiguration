# Server installation/configuration

**We assume that you have installed the operating system and you've aware of the basic commands**

This document describe the "basic" configuration of a new server using both "classical" approach and Docker approach.

## Creation of a new user

```bash
adduser newuser
ls -l /home/newuser
```

**_If the root rights are needed_**

```bash
su root _command_
```

- If the password need to be redefined :

```bash
passwd concernedUser
```

**For security purpose, be sure to connect with this user instead of root !**

## CRON tasks

**If needed, a online configurator is available for building the schedule of the task** :

[Crontab generator](https://crontab-generator.org/)

Once the periodicity defined, create a new file :

```bash
touch /usr/bin/named_file.sh
chmod a+x /usr/bin/named_file.sh
nano named_file.sh # For example
```

- Example for apt-get update & upgrade commands ([Example file](CRON/update.sh)):

Copy the needed content into the file and save him.

```bash
crontab â€“e
```

If needed, define the editor to nano or vim, once the cron task added/copied, save the file.
The console should display :

```bash
crontab: installing new crontab
```

## Git

```bash
apt-get install git -y
git --version # For verification purpose.
```

## Nginx

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install -y nginx
```

- Open the ipadress/ and check that Nginx homepage is visible.

## Apache

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install apache2 -y
```
- Open the ipaddress/ or www.domain.extension/ in browser

Should show the debian webpage.

# Cerbot (SSL certificate)

```bash
wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
chmod a+x certbot-auto
mv certbot-auto /usr/bin/certbot
certbot --apache (or --nginx)
```

- Open an www.domain.extension endpoint pointing into the server and make sure that the https:// endpoint is available.

- Define a CRON task for auto renew (Every 30 days here) :

```bash
crontab -e
```

```bash
0 0 30 * * /usr/bin/certbot renew >/dev/null 2>&1 # Adapt according to your installation.
```

Save the file and check that the success message is visible.

```bash
crontab: installing new crontab
```

## DNS

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install bind9 -y
apt-get install bind9-doc -y # For evolution purpose
```

- If configuration :

```bash
cp /etc/bind/named.conf /etc/bind/named.conf.backup
/etc/init.d/bind9 restart
```

## Postfix (email sender)

```bash
apt-get install postfix -y
```

During the installation, choose "Internet website" and enter the desired email "placeholder" when you see your ip showing.

## PostgreSQL

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
apt-get install postgresql postgresql-client
su -u postgres psql
```

Once in the Postgres CLI :

```bash
\ password
```
Enter the desired password & repeat him.

- If you need to quit :

```bash
\ q
```

## MySQL

```bash
apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client -y
```

- Try to connect to the instance :

```bash
mysql -p userdefined -u passwordlinked
exit # If you need to close the CLI
```

# Server installation/configuration - DevOps

## Classical (Can be use inside a CRON task)

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y
```

## Docker + Docker-Compose + Docker Swarm

```bash
sudo apt-get install \ apt-transport-https \ ca-certificates \ curl \ gnupg2 \ software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID")/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

- Check for the fingerprint (9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88) :

```bash
apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```

- Add the repository and install Docker-CE

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(. /etc/os-release; echo "$ID") \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get install docker-ce -y
```

- Check the installation :

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

You should see something similar :

```bash
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
5b0f327be733: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:07d5f7800dfe37b8c2196c7b1c524c33808ce2e0f74e7aa00e603295ca9a0972
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

### Docker-Compose

[Documentation]('https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/')

### Docker Swarm

```bash
docker -v
docker swarm init
```

**_The Docker compose version is defined in the [Docker repository](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases), be sure top use the latest_**

**_For simplicity, the Swarm mode is activated in order to achieve the service approach_**

## Gitlab - Enterprise Edition
